# Super Word Smash

Hello, I'm Teacher Chris!

*Super Word Smash* is a short and simple game I made for playing with kids and families at school festivals and other similar public events. It's a very simple game. The players work together to move a picture onto a word by moving a tablet. It looks like this:

## How I made the game

I made this game using an app called Godot. An app that helps you make games is called a game engine. Godot is a free game engine for everyone and you can use it to make games for things like computers, tablets, and smartphones.

## How you can make a game

Making a game is a lot of fun and I feel very happy when people enjoy playing a game that I made. Making a game can also be difficult and take a long time. Luckily, the people who make Godot also wrote some things that can help start learning how to make your own games.

## Take a look inside of Super Word Smash

After you practice making your first game using the links above, you can download *Super Word Smash* and see how it works -- you can even change the game or make it bigger! I did my best to keep everything organized and added lots of comments that explain what things do. For example, here's the code that controls how the balls (the little pictures) are able to move:

If you have any questions about how anything works, I will be more than happy to explain.

## License

This game has what's called an MIT License. That means I think it's OK if you make a copy of the game and change it. You can do whatever you want with it!

There are some parts of the game I didn't make, like the pictures and the music. Those have different licenses. You can still use them if you copy the game, but you can't sell them to other people. I put notes about their licenses in folders for those things.
